# About

This is my small programming project for my practical exam (UPRAK). This is a program that will download music from the Youtube Music website to the user's computer by entering the music link. This program is written in Python.

I wrote the code of this program in a single file for the convenience of transferring the file for testing and presentation purposes. As a result, the code may be a bit messy. But I tried to write it as clearly as possible for easy reading.
